Have a look around, or read on for instructions on how to contribute. Markdown Guide MkDocs, the program used to generate this site, lets the author write articles with simple markdown. A quick cheatsheet is available here . You can use this site as a sandbox to play around in, or to use to preview your articles as you write them. It's pretty cool. Article Submission Unfortunately, MkDocs doesn't currently support easy collaboration, with a building and uploading process being required to make any changes. Therefore, it's easier to have one administrator in charge of adding new articles and updating the site, with all other authors submitting articles as they are written to be added. The documentation administrator will be labelled clearly under the Contributors page, along with their contact information where you can send your own articles or proposed changes. If you'd like to edit a page you don't have the original file for, you can also ask the documentation administrator for the markdown file. Try to keep the total number of submitted edits to a minimum in order to reduce workload. If you think you might want to make more changes to a file in the near future, hold off on submitting the request until you're certain the information will remain correct for some time. A page shouldn't need more than a couple of revisions per week at the most.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"This site contains programming documentation for Centrum City.

Doing so will help keep the game's codebase in a secure, well-managed state. Security Keeping the game's systems impervious to exploiters is essential to providing a quality gameplay experience to everyone. Doing so can involve numerous complex methods, but building unhackable systems in the first place can be boiled down to one assumption: Assume everyone is hacking your game. They can use, edit, and steal anything replicated to their machine, including remotes. This is essential to keep in mind as you work. Here are some other pointers: Don't let remotes going to the server do anything meaningful. If you must, use sanity checks, and be as careful as possible. Don't store anything important such as API keys or passwords in client-sided code. The exploiter will be able to read these. Rely on a player's location as little as possible, and don't expect geometry to keep them out of sensitive areas. Keep information, code, and components server-sided as much as possible to diminish the importance of leaks. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're not sure how something should be designed. More than one brain is more powerful than one.

Adding Game Pass Weapons Due to the number of game pass exclusive weapons, there is now an easy way to quickly add new ones. A table on line 16 (at the time of writing) called gamePassWeapons contains a list of corresponding game pass IDs and weapon names. Please adhere to this format when adding new entries: Key Value ID The ID of the game pass, typically as defined in PurchaseManager Name The name of the weapon in the Items folder Adding Badge Weapons There is a near-identical workflow for submitting badge-exclusive weapons following the same format, but with the table on line 23 (at the time of writing) called badgeWeapons. There's currently no specific location to contain badge IDs, so simply pasting in the given number is appropriate.
